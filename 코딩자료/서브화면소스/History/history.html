    <h2>Since When Has the Korean Peninsula Been Inhabited by People?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Man began to populate the Korean peninsula some 700,000 years ago. The tools made by the people of the time were excavated from the caves in which they dwelled. 
        During this period of the Ice Age and the Interglacial Age1), there was a time when Korea was linked with China and Japan by land. Since people of the times migrated 
        while gathering and hunting for food, it is not clear whether these inhabitants were actually the ethnic ancestors of the Korean people.</p>
    <h2>The world at the time</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Geumgul cave in Danyang and the Evolution of Mankind
        Many artifacts used more than 700,000 years ago including choppers and hand exes were unearthed in the Geumgul archaeological site in Danyang, 
        North Chungcheong Province. Inhabitants of the period were Homo erectus. Considering the fact that traces of man over 1.8 million years old were unearthed in China, 
        it may be surmised that human beings have dwelled on the Korean peninsula sine 700,000 years ago. It was some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago that Homo sapiens, 
        believed to be the direct ancestors of mankind of today, first appeared on Earth. Recently, human bones from this period were excavated in North Korea.</p>

    <h2>The Han People of Korea Were Established During the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">The Ice Age ended around 8000 B.C.2)The geographical features of the areas surrounding Korea substantially became what they are today. The climate, too, 
        became similar to what it is today. During this period, people used sharp-edged tools made by chipping large stones. People lived by hunting and catching fish 
        with these tools. Gradually, they began to engage in farming and raising livestock. As they changed from a hunting and gathering economy to one of production, 
        people stopped migrating and began to settle down in one place. They came out of the caves and began to build houses. Gradually, a form of settled communal life 
        developed and villages were established. Around the 15th to 10th century B.C., during the Bronze Age, rice cultivation was introduced and agriculture was developed. 
        People’s lives became more stabilized and villages grouped together to form larger communities. Political societies were organized in various parts of the region. 
        People who settled on the Korean peninsula during this period, as well as those who migrated from the north in search of a warmer climate, became the ancestors 
        of the Korean people of today. History books record them as the Yemaek people or the Han people of Korea. The word Hanguk, meaning Korea, is derived from 
        the Han people.</h2>
