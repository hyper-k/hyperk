<p style="text-align:justify">Founded in 1946 by the merger of ten higher education institutions, Seoul National University enjoys a prestige 
    unlike any other Korean university. It endured a tumultuous time during the mid-20th century, becoming one of Japan’s Imperial 
    Universities during its occupation of Korea, and it was taken over by North Korea during the Korean War of the 1950s.
    It’s experiencing happier times now though, with some 28,000 students enrolled on undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programs. 
    There are also partnerships and exchange programs operated with over 700 academic institutions in 40 countries, including a general 
    academic exchange program with the University of Pennsylvania, and double-degrees with the MIT Sloan School of Management and Yale School of Management. 
    Sixteen colleges of the university offer 83 undergraduate degree programs, while for master’s and doctoral programs there is a graduate 
    school with 99 programs across five fields of studies. A recent study found that Seoul National University spends more on its students 
    than any other large university in Korea. 
    The university has three campuses: the main Gwanak campus is located in southern Seoul, the medical campus is situated in the north-east 
    of the city, while another campus lies 126km away in the city of Pyeongchang, the host city of the Winter Olympics. 
    There are dormitory rooms on campus, most of which are doubles with en-suite bathrooms and facilities, as well as studio apartments. 
    Students live, work and socialize on campus, which contains all the facilities needed for a healthy and happy student life. There are 
    plenty of cafeterias and snack bars on campus (though vegetarians may find the Korean diet a challenge), and a wide range of clubs, 
    societies and activities designed to fill students’ social calendars and immerse foreign students in Korean culture. 
    Sporting activities, whether competitive or recreational, keep students in good shape mentally and physically, while arts and culture 
    also rank highly on the list of what to do on campus, with students able to visit a world-class art gallery as well as attend concerts 
    and recitals by anyone from the top K-pop sensation of the day to classically trained musicians.

<p style="text-align:justify">Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST was South Korea’s first research-oriented 
    science and engineering institution when it was founded in 1971. 
    For such as young university, KAIST’s standing is growing rapidly: it is widely acknowledged as the best university in Korea and has been 
    named the most innovative university in the Asia-Pacific region. 
    One of its stand-out research projects of recent years saw researchers develop an electric transport system, where vehicles get power from 
    cables underneath the road via 
    non-contact magnetic charging. It’s an example of how KAIST is leading the field in developing new technologies 
    that might tackle world problems such as energy consumption and congestion in cities. 
    Around 10,000 full-time students attend KAIST, split between 4,000 undergraduates and 6,000 postgraduates. Science, engineering and technology 
    are the school’s main focuses, though the university has branched out in recent years and is now internationally accredited in business education too. 
    It has also adopted dual degree programs with leading world universities such as Carnegie Mellon in the United States and the Technical University of Berlin, 
    and these offer its students diverse educational opportunities. 
    The university’s main campus is in Daedeok Science Town in the city of Daejeon, 150 kilometers south of the South Korean capital, Seoul. 
    There’s also another campus in Seoul itself, which is home to the business school as well as the graduate schools of finance, management and 
    information and media management. 
    Most lectures and research activities take place on the Daejeon main campus, which is also where most students live. There is a total of 29 
    dormitories on the outskirts of the Daedeok campus, strictly segregated along gender lines. There are also apartments for married students 
    outside the campus. Extracurricular activities on campus may not be a priority at KAIST, although there are clubs and societies for students, 
    and the university holds regular arts events including opera, drama, pop concerts, dance and classical recitals.

<p style="text-align:justify">Korea University was the nation's first university funded and administered solely by Koreans.  
    The university was founded in 1905 by Lee Young-Ik, Treasurer of the Royal Household, whose idea and vision was 
    that only by educating the younger generations could Korea secure its independence and grow and prosper as a nation.  
    For one-hundred years now, Korea University continues to maintain the spirit of its founder.  Today, the university 
    strives to educate its students to become effective citizens, highly capable in their chosen fields, who will dedicate 
    themselves to serving the nation and world to the best of their abilities.
    Korea University is home to over 33,000 students from all parts of the nation and ever corner of the globe.  
    Students at the university are enrolled in eighteen colleges and divisions, and eighteen graduate schools, ranging 
    from the Humanities to Engineering and Science, the East Asiatic Research Center, the Korean Cultural Research Center, 
    and the recently established inter-disciplinary Graduate School of International Studies.
    The university also has highly regarded professional schools of Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Business Administration.  
    In addition, the university maintains a fine teaching hospital, Korea University Hospital, which provides excellent medical 
    care for its patients, and trains student doctors and nurses who will serve the nation and the world in the years to come.
    The university's spacious and wooded campus of over 182 acres is in the heart of Seoul in the An-Am neighborhood and is 
    convenient to subway and metro bus lines.  The architecture of the campus is in the Gothic style of Middle Ages Europe.  
    Inside the majestic buildings students enjoy learning in comfortable, attractive classrooms and modern, up-to-date laboratories.  
    In addition, fully equipped computer centers are located all over campus.  For the students' convenience and relaxation, 
    there is the new Central Plaza with restaurants, coffee shops, a book store, and study rooms.
    The university faculty numbers more than 1,10095 percent of whom hold a Ph.D., or the highest degree in their fields.  
    Although many faculty members have achieved international reputations through their scholarly work and research, itis their 
    teaching that most distinguishes them and the university, and benefits the students.  All of the faculty share the commitment 
    of bestowing on the students of Korea University an education of the highest quality that will prepare the students to be leaders 
    and innovators in their fields of endeavor.
   Korea University achieved much in its first one-hundred years, but this is only a beginning.  As the university continues to 
   attract highly capable and deserving students and provide them with the best educational opportunities possible, the university 
   also strives to maintain itself as not only one of the best universities in Korea and in Asia.  The goal of the university 
   is to be nothing less than to be one of the great universities on Earth.

<p style="text-align:justify">Hanyang University was established in 1939 by Lyun-Joon Kim, who desired greatly for the advancement of the country through technology education. 
    In 1948, it was the first private university that actually developed by the engineering department and in 1959, it expanded into different ranges. In addition, in 1979, 
    Hanyang University built their second campus in Ansan, Gyeonggi-do, one of the biggest industrial complexes in our country. As of 2011, 
    Hanyang University has 2 campuses with students in all from both college and graduate school. It is also operating a hospital that 
    has a large scale of having approximately 1,400 sickbeds. This in all shows how big the university is and what kind of important role it play in our country. 
    After Hanyang University was established, for 72 years, it has been concentrating its effort in the education theory of fostering talented students 
    by following the idea of trying to become a university that can be of help to the society through practical method of study. As a result, between the 70s and the 80s, 
    Hanyang University was acknowledged for discharging excellent students who have contributed to the country's phenomenal change in both the industrial area and modern age. 
    Hanyang University was very proud of starting out in the area engineering, but now it is even more proud of the reputation that it carries as it slowly expanded 
    the education range to medical, humanities, social sciences, performing arts, and much more. Thus, through the program of fostering a global leader, 
    all of this accomplishment continues even to this very day and it is being recognized as one of the biggest promising universities that can actually develop and 
    make a difference. Hanyang University was built on the spirit of Love in Truth, and in Deed. Its purpose was to educate the students to understand what love is 
    and how they can act upon it through hard work, honesty, politeness, and community service. It is not only about trying to improve only one's education, 
    but by contributing to the local community and the country, a person will able to grow love for humanities in all. Hanyang University's technology patriotism of 
    philosophy that serves as a background to the school's establishment is 'Practical Method of Study' which has been in succession in the education tradition for 
    a very long time. For this reason and due to the society's demand, the school has developed and stabilized itself as a group culture that can rapidly satisfy 
    the needs of the society through education and research. Consequently, it has been deemed to be the university that has contributed the most to our country's 
    modern age and industrialism. Since Erica campus is very close to the industrial complex, it has taken advantage of that geographical attribute by opening up 
    the biggest Center for Business Incubation as well as a Technopark. Moreover, it is trying to construct the biggest ERICA cluster in our country so that 
    it can focus on placing corporations and government research centers within the campus.
